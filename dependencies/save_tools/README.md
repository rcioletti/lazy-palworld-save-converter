## Important Python Installation Note
- Please make sure to use the official version of Python via [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads), NOT the WindowsApps version of Python. Otherwise, you may encounter issues due to downloading and installing packages. 
- If you encounter any issues even after using the official version of Python, please install the Visual C++ Redistributable AIO from:  
[Visual C++ Redistributable AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases).
- If the cityhash hasn't been installed for some reason, likely C++ not working/broken/etc: You might have to download [VS build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
- If that fails, you may try my pre-compiled version of cityhash package [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dbz4zikmmqawpbo56a7d0/external_libs.zip?rlkey=xf6vz30qlmxrpgpr1aw2117p8&st=4oec5601&dl=1).

### Installation Directions for AIO

## Transferring Local Saves to Server
_read the fix_host_save_readme.txt for instructions and make sure to check the fix_host_save_screenshots for clear images on how to do the instructions properly_
- Make sure to disable private locks on the "host" chests.
- If you are trying to use GamePass saves(Xbox Platform), make sure to use XPG save extractor then convert it to json. Then reconvert json back to Level.sav. Then use the tool.

## How to Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity
1. Copy everything from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) into the same location within the tool (`PalworldSaveTools\`).
2. Run `fix_save.cmd`.
3. Run `sort_players.cmd` and/or `delete_pals_save.cmd`.
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the tool.
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.
7. Profit?

## Additional Notes
- **Days:** Tracks players inactive for a specified number of days (e.g., 30 days and older).
- **Level:** Tracks players up to a specified level (e.g., level 30 or lower).
- **Pals:** Deletes players based on the number of pals (e.g., 10 or fewer pals).
- The fixed save (`PalworldSaveTools\fixed\Level.sav`) is no longer functional after patch v0.3+.
- As of update v0.5.5, you can view the total number of pals caught/owned. To do so, copy the server's `Players` folder into the tool's `Players` folder.
