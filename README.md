# Game Pass save to Steam easy transfer

Important: I don't code in Python and I don't play Palworld. My wife needed to transfer her save file so I did it. Please keep that in mind.

This tool transfers a Palworld save file in Xbox Game Pass to Steam in two clicks.

### Instructions

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/rcioletti/lazy-palworld-save-converter/releases)
2. Un-zip the file in a folder then open **lazy_converter.exe**
3. Click on **Get Saves** to get your save data from Game Pass (this could take up to **10 minutes** depending on how large your save files are)

7. Open your game and check your saves.

### Troubleshooting

> Delete everything inside _./saves_ folder and delete the ZIP file in the root folder.\
> Delete any ZIP files that don't have the prefix "palworld\_".\
> Run **lazy_converter.exe** as Admin
